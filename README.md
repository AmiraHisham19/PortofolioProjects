COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis (SQL Server)

Developed a comprehensive data analysis project using real-world COVID-19 global datasets. The project involved writing complex SQL queries to:
- Analyze case trends, death rates, and infection percentages by location and date
- Identify countries with the highest infection and death counts
- Calculate daily and cumulative global statistics using aggregate and window functions
- Join vaccination data with case data to evaluate vaccination rollout impact
- Implement Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and views for modular and efficient querying
- Emphasized data accuracy through type casting, precision handling, and null-safe calculations
